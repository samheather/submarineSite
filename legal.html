                <h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>
                <p>Use of this service, our apps/browsers and website is subject to the terms of use displayed here. By using our service, you agree to be bound by these terms.</p>
                  
                <p>You agree to have read and understood any applicable <a href="disclaimer.php">disclaimers</a> and <a href="policies.php">policies</a> displayed on this website (links on the homepage of www.branon.co.uk). We reserve the right to change these at any time.</p>

                <p>You may not use this service for any unlawful activity, including but not limited to viewing illegal content, sharing copyrighted Intellectual Property, or sending threatening, harassing or abusive email.</p>

                <p>You may not access webmail services for the purpose of sending spam or unsolicited email.</p>

                <p>You may not attempt to gain unauthorised access to any website. You may not use our service to abuse any third-party services that may be available through our website. This includes bypassing any restrictions that other webmasters may have put in place against your IP address and accessing content that is unavailable in your country.</p>

                <p>You accept that your location and other information may be collected by third party services such as advertisers e.g. in order to provide more targeted advertising.</p>
                
                
                
                <h3>Disclaimers</h3>
                <p>This service is provided as is, without warranty of any kind. Use of this service is entirely at your own risk. We cannot take responsibility for any direct or indirect damages resulting from the use of this service.</p>

   	            <p>The service allows indirect browsing of external, third-party websites. We are not responsible for the content on any external websites that may be accessible through our service. A website viewed through our service is in no way owned by or associated with this website.</p>

   	            <p>The term &quot;indirect browsing&quot; refers to the server which you connect to. During &quot;direct&quot; browsing, you connect to the server which provides the resource you are requesting. During &quot;indirect&quot; browsing, you connect to our server. Our script downloads the requested resource and forwards it to you.</p>

      	        <p>Any resource (such as web pages, images, files) downloaded through our service may be modified. This may include, but is not limited to, editing URLs so that any resources referenced by the target resource are also downloaded indirectly. The accuracy and reliability of this process is not guaranteed. The resource which you receive may not be an accurate representation of the resource requested.</p>

      	        <p>A side-effect of indirect browsing may be anonymity. By connecting to our server instead of the target server, the target server does not see your IP address. However, we do not guarantee our service will be truly anonymous. The downloaded resource may reference other resources which your browser may automatically download. The service attempts to reroute all such requests through our server but may not be entirely successful. A single direct request will compromise your anonymity.</p>

      	        <p>This service may download a resource over a secure connection but this may be sent back to you over an unsecure connection. Do not enter confidential information.</p>

      	        <p>Third party services used in this App/Service may collect your location and other information for their own purposes.  These include providing targeted advertising.</p>

                
                
                <h3>Policies</h3>
                <p>These policies are for a) All Apps and Services published under the names of "Branon" and "Samuel B Heather" (or variants of) and b) All Apps/Services linking to them in the context of them being the policies for that App or Service.  All sections relevant to the App/Service apply for that App/Service.</p>
      	        
      	        <h4>Main Policy - Acceptable Use Policy</h4>

                <p>To use Branon, either website or services, you must agree to the following terms and conditions. If you disagree, you may not use our site AND services.</p>
      	        
      	        <p>Where the terms 'website' or 'service' are used, they are intended from here forth to both include each other.</p>
      	        
      	        <p>Where the term Browsers is used, it is intended from here forth to indicate any of the web browsing applications that we provide, available from our website. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to:</p>
      	        
      	        
      	        <p>iPhone/iPad Browser (Both Free and Pro editions).<br>
   	            - Android Browser (Both Free and Pro Editions).<br>
   	            - Mac Anonymous Browser (Both Free and Pro Editions).<br>
   	            - Windows Anonymous Browser (Both Free and Pro Editions).</p>
      	        </p>
      	        
      	        
      	      <p>Our website and service is maintained for your personal use and viewing. Access and use by you of our site constitutes your acceptance of this acceptable usage policy. This policy takes effect on you as a user from the date on which you first use our website and/or services. We may at any time revise our policies (including this one) without notice, and therefore they should be regularly checked. The continued use of the site/service after a change constitutes your acceptance of the change/new Acceptable Use Policy. Acceptance of this acceptable use policy and use of our service also indicates acceptance of our other policies, which can be viewed by from the link in the footer of the Branon web site. As with this policy, our other policies may change without notice, and so should also regularly checked.</p>
   	          
   	          <p>You agree to use this site and its services only for lawful purposes, and in a manner that does not infringe the rights of, or restrict or inhibit the use of this site and its services by any third party, such as other users/subscribers/visitors. Such prohibitions include using our Anonymous Browsing Service to upload or download malicious files or software that may have an effect on the downloader or their computer/server and our web servers. Such restrictions or inhibitions includes, without limitation, conduct which is unlawful, or which may harass or cause distress or inconvenience to any person, and the transmission of obscene or offensive content or disruption to the normal flow of dialogue within this site. </p>
      	      
      	      <p>Information is not normally shared with other organisations except when we are legally required to. You may request to view all data or information stored about you, and to have these data modified or permanently deleted. Information submitted to us specifically or through another platform/API about us (such as the iTunes leave a review function) may well be used/published at our discretion (e.g. reviews been placed on the home page of Branon.co.uk).</p>
      	      
   	          <p>Branon always aims to operate for the "Greater Good" of society. Hence, if we see fit, we may release any of our records to any group or individual whom we deem to be justified in their request. It should be noted that we do keep log files of users IP addresses, sites visited and date/time of visit. Other data may however remain in a server cache, or have not been deleted from the third party services whom we use, which we would be unaware of and therefore have no accountability.
   	          
   	          <p>No offensive, illegal, malicious or stolen content is permitted to be transmitted through our servers. Breach of this rule may cause instant suspension or termination of your service. The content of all data viewed must comply with UK law AND the law of any other relevant country and (if applicable) establishment. The use of this service in a way that causes, deliberately or otherwise, damage or corruption to data or hardware is not permitted.</p>

   	          <p>Branon reserve the right to terminate the service or suspend any user at their discretion, though this will usually be due to a breach in this Acceptable Use Policy. Refunds are not offered for suspended or terminated users.</p>

   	          <p>No offensive or malicious material may be downloaded or uploaded through our services or website. The use of our service and content of sites viewed through our browser (whether hosted on the site you are viewing or simply linked/framed to), including their content, must stick to all laws set forth by the UK and other relevant countries and (if applicable) establishments. The use of these our service (including, but not restricted to installing malicious or otherwise unwanted software onto another users computer) in a way that causes, deliberately or otherwise, damage or corruption to data or hardware, except that owned by the operator is not permitted and strictly prohibited.</p>
      	      
   	          <p>We do not have a guaranteed uptime. We always aim to keep down time to a minimum, but sometimes it is unavoidable. Purchases of our Browser Application (all programs that browse trough our service, purchasable from us) represents a purchase of the software, not the service, and therefore we reserve the right to close the Branon service at any time (with no notice to users) without refund to users (since the service is free, it is the Browser you buy). </p>

   	          <p>Any user found to be in breach of this acceptable use policy will be banned permanently. Note; we reserve the right to suspend, terminate or take any other action on the provision of service to a user or user group at our discretion.</p>
      	      
   	          <p>Where this agreement is in conflict with any applicable law, the law will be enforced.</p>

   	          <h4>UCE (Unsolicited Commerce Email) – SPAM</h4>

   	          <p>Spamming, or the sending of mass unsolicited email through a Branon service is STRICTLY prohibited. Branon will be the sole arbiter as to what constitutes a violation of this provision. If you engage in any of the foregoing activities using the service of another ISP or IPP, but channeling activities through our service, you are in violation of our Acceptable Use Policy. Violators will face an immediate suspension.</p>
      	      
   	          <h4>Data Protection and Collection</h4>
      	      
   	          <p>As previously noted, we do not purposefully keep user information which woudld easily identify a user. We keep IP addresses, URL's of sites and content visited and date/time the content is viewed.  The third party services we use may keep other logs which we have no control over. By agreeing to this policy, as required to use our site and services, you agree that this is acceptable to you.</p>
   	          
   	          <p>We do not keep logs that could identify a user on banned users. Our service may collect information about you during your visit. The following sections describes the information we collect and how it is used.</p>
      	      
      	      <h4>Server Access Logs</h4>

      	      <p>Our server logs all requests. The data recorded includes information provided by your browser (user agent and referring page) as well as the requested URL, the time and date and your IP address. The data recorded in these logs may be used for detecting and preventing abuse. We may also collate these data for statistical purposes.</p>

   	         <p>The service provided on this website allows access to external, third-party websites. We may record your IP address and the websites you visit.

Any violations of our terms of use may result in disclosure of the data recorded in our logs to an appropriate third party, which may include your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or local authorities. We may also be required, by law, to provide logs of our service and if requested, such data will be disclosed. We may also use service logs for statistical purposes.</p>

      	      <h4>Specfiic Information on Third Party Data Collection</h4>
      	      
   	          <p>In many cases our advertisers request location information in order to be able to better target adverts.  By using this service, you accept this occurs automatically unless you disable it on your device.</p>

              <h4>Cookies</h4>

   	          <p>Our website stores a cookie on your computer, if allowed by your browser's privacy settings *. The cookie used by our service uniquely identifies you to the server and allows our website to remember your preferences.</p>
